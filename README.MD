## Introduction

This repository serves as the home for the Integrative Project of the Initial JavaScript course. It's designed to demonstrate the practical application of the concepts and skills learned throughout the course.

## Project Description

The creation of an application for the processing of statistical data, which is extremely simple to use and does not require any type of installation.

## Workflow

We follow a development workflow inspired by GitFlow, which provides a structured approach to branch management. While we use GitFlow as a guideline, we also maintain the flexibility to adapt the workflow as needed to fit the requirements of our project.

## Javascript Libraries Used

This project leverages the following JavaScript libraries to enhance its functionality:

- jQuery is employed in this project to streamline client-side scripting and enhance the user interface.
- Handlebars is utilized in this project to efficiently manage and generate HTML content dynamically.

## SASS and Responsive Grid

The project utilizes SASS for the styling and implements a responsive grid system with 12 columns. This approach allows for efficient styling and ensures that the project adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices.
